# cppnotes

This repository contains a collection of documents which each attempt to cover
a different aspect of C++. The documents are aimed at readers who are familiar
with programming in languages other than C or C++.

The documents are mostly independent, but some details leak between different
documents. I have inserted links where I have noticed this, but I may have
missed some instances. It may be necessary to jump back and forth. If you are
aiming to read all of the documents, the recommended order of reading is:

  * [Basic Syntax](basic-syntax.md) - An introduction to C++ syntax
    peculiarities.
  * [Compiler Components](compiler-components.md) - The different stages of
    compilation which a programmer can benefit from knowing about.
  * [User-defined Types](user-defined-types.md) - The tools available for
    creating custom types in C++.
  * [Value Types](value-types.md) - Value semantics and the difference they
    make.
  * [Smart Pointers](smart-pointers.md) - What they are and when to use them.

There is also a list of [topics which I have not written about](topics.md),
which outlines some of the documents that I have considered but have not yet
written.
