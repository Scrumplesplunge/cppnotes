    * A `namespace` is not a module.
    * When to use `::`.
    * Argument-dependent lookup.

    * Why does runtime polymorphism require pointers (or references)?
    * Virtual methods.
    * Overriding vs. overloading.
    * Inheritance and multiple inheritance.
    * Virtual inheritance.
  * Templates
    * Basic syntax.
    * Comparison against templates in Java.
    * Variadic templates.
