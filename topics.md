Unexplored topics
=================

These are some of the topics about which I have thought about writing an
explanation, but haven't actually got round to doing so.

  * Compiling, linking, and the C preprocessor.
    * How compilers and linkers fit together.
    * Preprocessor directives (`#include`, `#define`, ...).
    * Useful predefined macros (`__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__func__`, ...).
    * Special operators inside macro definitions (`#`, `##`).
    * Calling macros from macros.
  * Namespaces and name resolution
    * A `namespace` is not a module.
    * When to use `::`.
    * Argument-dependent lookup.
  * Object Oriented Programming
    * Why does runtime polymorphism require pointers (or references)?
    * Virtual methods.
    * Overriding vs. overloading.
    * Inheritance and multiple inheritance.
    * Virtual inheritance.
  * Templates
    * Basic syntax.
    * Comparison against templates in Java.
    * Variadic templates.
